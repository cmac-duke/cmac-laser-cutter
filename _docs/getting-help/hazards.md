Hazards: <br>
The X-660 and VLS660 laser cutters are designed specifically to allow safe laser processing in office, lab or workshop environments. The safety enclosure allows for operation without additional personal protection equipment, but users must still be aware of the potential hazards. <br>

Optical: <br>
Exposure to the laser beam may cause physical burns and can cause severe eye
damage. <br>
Electrical:
There are high voltage hazards housed within the rear compartments of the
enclosure. Access to these areas is not necessary during normal use. <br>

Fumes: <br>
The cutting process produces fumes and smoke that may be toxic. The exhaust fan must be kept running at all times during operation to extract these hazards. Some materials such as acrylic will continue to off-gas after being cut. These materials should be moved to a well ventilated area after processing. <br>
