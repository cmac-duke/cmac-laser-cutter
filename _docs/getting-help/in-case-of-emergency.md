Emergency Procedures

Life-Threatening Emergency: <br>
• For a life-threatening emergency such as electrical shock, fire, etc. dial 911 for emergency response.<br>
• Contact the Stuckeman Digital Fabrication Supervisor at 814-883-3247.<br>
• The supervisor will contact the EHS Laser Safety Officer.<br>


Non-Life-Threatening Emergencies:<br>
• Seek appropriate medical attention for those exposed to the hazard. 
• Notify the Digital Fabrication Supervisor.<br>
• The Supervisor will notify EHS.<br>
EHS will investigate the circumstances of the event. The laser system in question will be removed from service pending the results of the investigation and completion of any necessary corrective actions.

Fire<br>
When processing combustable materials fire can easily develop. It is normal for the laser to produce a constant small flame when cutting thick or dense materials, but flames must not extend closer than 1 inch to the lens. If flames become too large or material catches on fire processing must be stopped immediately. Users must monitor the machines at all times while operating extinguish any fire that may develop. Improper laser settings and lens focus greatly increase the chances of fire developing.<br>
Always leave the exhaust fan running to exhaust smoke and fumes from the building.


Localized Flame: (if the flame produced by the laser becomes too large)<br>
• Press the Pause button on the laser cutter or software control panel.
or<br>
• Lift the top lid slightly. This triggers the safety interlocks and immediately turns<br>
off the cutting laser. The machine will pause and the carriage will return to the home position.<br>
• Localized flames will generally cease when the laser turns off.<br>
• Evaluate power settings and lens focus. Improper settings are generally the
cause of unexpected flames.<br>
• Check the lens and clean if necessary before resuming operation.<br>
<br>

Material Fire: (if the material is burning beyond a localized flame)<br>
• Lift the top lid slightly. This triggers the safety interlocks and immediately turns<br>
off the cutting laser. The machine will pause and the carriage will return to the home position.<br>
• If the fire is small and the top lid can safely be opened, use the water spray bottle to extinguish any flames.<br>
- Check the lens for damage and clean if necessary before resuming work. <br>
-  - Inform the Digital Fabrication Supervisor of the incident. <br>
<br>
• If the fire is large it will be necessary to use the halotron fire extinguisher. <br>
- Open the front door of the laser cutter.<br>
- Apply the fire extinguisher through the front door.<br>
- Call the Digital Fabrication Supervisor immediately. Do not resume
operation.<br>
Incase of fire beyond the machine enclosure call 911 for University Police immediately.<br>
