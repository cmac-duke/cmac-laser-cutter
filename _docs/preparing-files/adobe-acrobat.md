Using Adobe Acrobat:<br>
Convert image to PDF<br>
Print / Properties<br>
Epilog Printer Properties:<br>
General Settings:<br>
DPI - No reason to go higher than image resolution. 300 or 400 is good default setting<br>
<br>
Options - Auto Focus and Center Engraving:<br>
Uncheck Laser Type - C02 (This is the type of laser on the printer)<br>
Job Type - Choose the type of image<br>
Raster images will burn the surface of the material based on the light and dark portions of the image
Vector images will cut the material by burning strait through

<br>
Rotary Options: UncheckPiece size - Horizon is the x axis, Vertical in the y axis (the ruler going up and down on the left side of the metal grid)<br>
Engrave-Direction should be set to “Top-Down” if the home coordinates were set to the top left corner of the material. The other setting, “Bottom-Up” should be used in the home coordinates were set to the bottom right corner of the material.<br>
Image dithering will adjust how the dots of the image are distributed. Default is set to Standard.<br>
Adjust Raster and Vector settings<br>
Check manual for common settings (based on material) as a starting point. Use online epilog forum as another resource.<br>
Speed refers to the speed of the laser head (high speed will result in higher resolution - smaller dots being created like small pixels in an image
Power refers to the intensity of the laser. For burnable objects like paper, you should use a high speed and low power so the material won’t catch fire.
Frequency is only available for vector images. This refers to the number of pulses per inch. Too few pulses per inch will result in a series of dots that do not connect, and therefore will not cut through the material.<br>
Vector sorting default is Optimize<br>
Speed Comp: Uncheck<br>
Power Comp: Grayed out and checked<br>
Advanced Settings:<br>
Generally not needed. Used for printing on rubber for stamps<br>
Color Mapping:<br>
Used to map color values to light and dark values<br>
